            The <b> chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red jungle <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, is a type of domesticated fowl,
            originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be
            called a
            cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was
            originally
            a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now
            become the
            most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources common fowl
            or
            domestic fowl were typically used for this.
            <p>Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
                Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BCE).<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">[1]</a>></sup>
                [2]
                Humans now
                keep chickens primarily as a source of food
                (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>An adult male is a called a cock or rooster (in the United States) and an adult female is called a
                hen.[10][11]

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>Chickens are omnivores.[25] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and
                even
                animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[26] or young mice.[27]</p>

            <h3>Behavior</h3>

            <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
            <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                incubation of
                eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking
                order",
